# Contributing

**Thank you for for contributing!**

## Pull Request Process

**U**n**HOC** is a community project, so pull requests are always welcome, but, before working on a change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with other contributors and maintainers.

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Make changes.
3. Ensure all tests pass.  
   `yarn test` or `yarn test:watch`
4. Add yourself to the end of the [contributors](README.md#Contributors) list in the README.md file with a short subject of the contribution made and a link to your GitHub profile. E.g.
   > - **Graeme Cassels** - _Initial work_ - [cassels](https://github.com/cassels)
5. Commit your changes and create PR.  
   _Tip: Ensure you have merged any upstream changes before creating PR_
